# JSON data examples from no auth public APIs

This is a collection of interesting JSON data to use in JavaScript and web development teaching, prior to the students learning how to use APIs.

See 0_index.json for the title of each API and example(s).

### technical note: recreating the collection:

It should not be necessary to do this.

Example command line to fetch example:

`curl -X GET "https://swapi.co/api/people/" -H "accept: application/json" > swapi_people.json`
